## SMS Classification

In this assignment I refactored a SMS Classification solution. The classification work was made into a function and a Gradio UI was created to make the program easy to use by a non programmer.


## Thoughts

It would be ideal for this program to reside on an email gateway that sits between the incoming mail server and the internet.   Email could then be flagged as spam in the subject line making it easy for users to recognize spam messages and create a mail rule to move them from the inbox.    This is preferable to blocking suspected spam because it will eliminate the possibility of an important message being blocked from the users view.

From the few examples in provided it seems the spam detection is focused on a response being requested by the sender.
